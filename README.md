# Welcome to my website # Stack: HTML/CSS, AngularJS, GitHub Pages 
This portfolio site is a reflection of how I think and build. I designed it with Angular, shaped it around reproducible deployment, and tuned it until every asset path and layout decision felt intentional. 

It’s where I collect the projects, experiments, and ideas that have grown out of my work in computer science, machine learning, and statistical reasoning. 
I like engineering that’s clean, scalable, and grounded in logic. Whether I’m debugging a layout issue or refining a deployment flow, I care about why things work and how to make them work better. My experience spans full-stack development, algorithm design, and technical research, and this site brings those threads together in one place. 

It’s part portfolio, part playground, and part ongoing experiment. If you’re here to explore what I’ve built or how I approach problems, you’re in the right spot.
